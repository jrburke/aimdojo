How to build the code
=====================
These instructions are how to build the code for the AOL CDN release, but it
should give you an idea on how to build it for your own project, if you do not
want to use the files from the CDN directly.

- Decide on a version number (something like 1.0.0).
- Update the index.html to use that version number. Make sure to modify
  the HTML source since there may be version references in the links.
- Check in the update to the docs.
- Update the keys in the test pages to be XXXX.
- Do a tag of the code.
- Fetch the tag.
- Remove _tasks.txt
- Create a ZIP file for source. Name it dojo-aim-version.zip.

- Download Dojo 1.1.0 source, place it as sibling to the aim module dir.
- cd dojo-release-1.1.0-src/util/buildscripts
- Run this build command:
  > ./build.sh profileFile=../../../aim/buildscripts/aim.profile.js version=1.1.0 releaseName=1.1.0 cssOptimize=comments.keepLines optimize=shrinksafe loader=xdomain xdDojoPath=http://o.aolcdn.com/dojo/1.1.0  action=release xdDojoScopeName=window[\(typeof\(djConfig\)\!\=\"undefined\"\&\&djConfig.scopeMap\&\&djConfig.scopeMap[0][1]\)\|\|\"dojo\"]

- cd to the dojo-release-1.1.0-src/release/1.1.0 directory.
- Copy the dojo-aim-version.zip to the aim directory.

- Copy auth.html and SoundBridge.swf into the tests directory.
- Get a new key for the tests directory, based on version path.
- Modify test pages to use this new key.
- Copy aim.wim with comments to wim.js.commented.js and make change index.html to link to it.

- Upload the code to the server.
